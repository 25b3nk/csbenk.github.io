Summary: My understanding of PyTorch.

Yo,  
This will be blog on my understanding on pytorch. I am following the [official tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html) for the same.  
First of all, let me tell you that I took two days to finish the 60 minute blitz. To be honest, I was distracted and had other work too. And [Soumith Chintala](http://soumith.ch/) has explained it in the best possible way. I loved the tutorial and now I feel like I can start off a new project with PyTorch without any fear.
